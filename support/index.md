#### When to use the app
This app can help you predict where weights should be mounted to your racing kart in order to get a desired weight distribution.


#### How to use the app
1. **Weigh your kart:** Use four scales, one under each tire to get your kart’s weight. (Bathroom scales can do the job for less than $40!) To ensure accuracy, you should be seated in your kart in full racing gear. For best results have another person read the scales for you. Changing your position in the kart will give incorrect measurements. It is VERY important to make sure that the tops of your scales are level with the other scales and all tires have the same pressure. 
2. **Record your kart’s weight:** In the “KartBalance” app, create a new “Base” by giving it a descriptive name, and enter the weight shown on the scales for all four tires.
3. **Add weights:** Go back to the main screen of the app. You will see the corner weights that you entered as well at the total weight of the kart. Add weights to the kart chassis by tapping within the blue square.  This will instantly calculate the weight and center of gravity.
4. **Move the weights:** You can move the weights on the kart by dragging them around. This allows you to see how the balance of the kart will be affected by adding a weight in that spot. Also, you can change how heavy a weight is by tapping on it. 

 
#### FAQ
**Q:** What units of weight measurement should I use? I don’t see "lbs" or "kg" anywhere.  
**A:** Use the unit of weight measurement you like. It does not matter what units you use as long as you are consistent. If you use two different units, your results will be incorrect.

**Q:** What weight distribution do I want?  
**A:** For most karts 43% Front / 57% Rear and 50% Left/Right
